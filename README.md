# Cat Clicker

This is the First project of the session _Front-End Application_ for the nano degree [Front End Web Developer](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).
For this first exercise, we need to create a page with an image of a *Cat* and each time we click on it  a counter display should update showing how many time we click the picture.

## How to Download it

To run this *App*, just click on _downloa/Clone_ button on the top right of the page or you can just copy the _URL_ in the _HTTPS_ section, open the *_Git Bash_*  and type _git clone_ and paste the _URL_ you copy before.

## How to run it:

* Open the _working Drirectory_ where you download the repository
* Open the *index.html* to run the application.
* Have Fun!!!!
